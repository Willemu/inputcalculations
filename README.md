# Instructions:

For the CodeSpace IWA User Input and Calculations challenge you can simply use the download zip option when clicking the code button and copy the files in 
this repo into your project (create your own project and copy the files over).

Once the files are copied you can continue working on your solution to the challenge

Goodluck and don't forget to commit regularly to your GitHub account.

User Input and Calculations
Getting input from an end-user and being able to manipulate that data is one of the fundamental aspects of creating an interactive web application. In this challenge we are going to create our first "true" app that makes use of the Input-Process-Output model. We take in a user input (as opposed to hard coding values into our app), process that data, and then display that processed data in our browser so the user can see the results.

 

Getting Started

Download or clone the template project on GitHub
If downloaded as a zip file; unzip the project and extract the whole folder
Open the repository/ folder in VSCode 
 

Brief

You are to use the template provided and add functionality to each of the 3 apps so they behave as intended.

The apps are:

A very basic VAT calculator
An app to convert Kilometers to Miles
An app to swap the values of 2 variables
 

Challenge

Look through the whole template to see if there are examples to assist you
Create constant variables where applicable (especially for reusable values)
Obtain input from the end-user via the prompt function
Use any arithmetic operators, extra variables to help you achieve the desired functionality
Output the result of your processing either through the DOM, console, or alert pop-up
Leave comments to separate and explain your code
